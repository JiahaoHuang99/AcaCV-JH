abstract: We present a novel graph transformer framework, HAMLET, designed to address
  the challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using neural networks.
  The framework uses graph transformers with modular input encoders to directly incorporate
  differential equation information into the solution process. This modularity enhances
  parameter correspondence control, making HAMLET adaptable to PDEs of arbitrary geometries
  and varied input formats. Notably, HAMLET scales effectively with increasing data
  complexity and noise, showcasing its robustness. HAMLET is not just tailored to
  a single type of physical simulation, but can be applied across various domains.
  Moreover, it boosts model resilience and performance, especially in scenarios with
  limited data. We demonstrate, through extensive experiments, that our framework
  is capable of outperforming current techniques for PDEs.
