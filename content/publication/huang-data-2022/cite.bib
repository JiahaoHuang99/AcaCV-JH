 abstract = {Research studies have shown no qualms about using data driven deep learning models for downstream tasks in medical image analysis, e.g., anatomy segmentation and lesion detection, disease diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment planning. However, deep learning models are not the sovereign remedy for medical image analysis when the upstream imaging is not being conducted properly (with artefacts). This has been manifested in MRI studies, where the scanning is typically slow, prone to motion artefacts, with a relatively low signal to noise ratio, and poor spatial and/or temporal resolution. Recent studies have witnessed substantial growth in the development of deep learning techniques for propelling fast MRI. This article aims to (1) introduce the deep learning based data driven techniques for fast MRI including convolutional neural network and generative adversarial network based methods, (2) survey the attention and transformer based models for speeding up MRI reconstruction, and (3) detail the research in coupling physics and data driven models for MRI acceleration. Finally, we will demonstrate through a few clinical applications, explain the importance of data harmonisation and explainable models for such fast MRI techniques in multicentre and multi-scanner studies, and discuss common pitfalls in current research and recommendations for future research directions.},
