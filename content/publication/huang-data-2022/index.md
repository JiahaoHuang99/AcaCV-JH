abstract: Research studies have shown no qualms about using data driven deep learning
  models for downstream tasks in medical image analysis, e.g., anatomy segmentation
  and lesion detection, disease diagnosis and prognosis, and treatment planning. However,
  deep learning models are not the sovereign remedy for medical image analysis when
  the upstream imaging is not being conducted properly (with artefacts). This has
  been manifested in MRI studies, where the scanning is typically slow, prone to motion
  artefacts, with a relatively low signal to noise ratio, and poor spatial and/or
  temporal resolution. Recent studies have witnessed substantial growth in the development
  of deep learning techniques for propelling fast MRI. This article aims to (1) introduce
  the deep learning based data driven techniques for fast MRI including convolutional
  neural network and generative adversarial network based methods, (2) survey the
  attention and transformer based models for speeding up MRI reconstruction, and (3)
  detail the research in coupling physics and data driven models for MRI acceleration.
  Finally, we will demonstrate through a few clinical applications, explain the importance
  of data harmonisation and explainable models for such fast MRI techniques in multicentre
  and multi-scanner studies, and discuss common pitfalls in current research and recommendations
  for future research directions.
