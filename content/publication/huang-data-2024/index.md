abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a pivotal clinical diagnostic tool,
  yet its extended scanning times often compromise patient comfort and image quality,
  especially in volumetric, temporal and quantitative scans. This review elucidates
  recent advances in MRI acceleration via data and physics-driven models, leveraging
  techniques from algorithm unrolling models, enhancement-based models, and plug-and-play
  models to emergent full spectrum of generative models. We also explore the synergistic
  integration of data models with physics-based insights, encompassing the advancements
  in multi-coil hardware accelerations like parallel imaging and simultaneous multi-slice
  imaging, and the optimization of sampling patterns. We then focus on domain-specific
  challenges and opportunities, including image redundancy exploitation, image integrity,
  evaluation metrics, data heterogeneity, and model generalization. This work also
  discusses potential solutions and future research directions, emphasizing the role
  of data harmonization, and federated learning for further improving the general
  applicability and performance of these methods in MRI reconstruction.
