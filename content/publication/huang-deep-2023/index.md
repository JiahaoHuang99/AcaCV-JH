abstract: In vivo cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) is a promising Magnetic
  Resonance Imaging (MRI) technique for evaluating the micro-structure of myocardial
  tissue in the living heart, providing insights into cardiac function and enabling
  the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. However, the integration of
  cDTI into routine clinical practice is challenging due to the technical obstacles
  involved in the acquisition, such as low signal-to-noise ratio and long scanning
  times. In this paper, we investigate and implement three different types of deep
  learning-based MRI reconstruction models for cDTI reconstruction. We evaluate the
  performance of these models based on reconstruction quality assessment and diffusion
  tensor parameter assessment. Our results indicate that the models we discussed in
  this study can be applied for clinical use at an acceleration factor (AF) of $times
  2$ and $times 4$, with the D5C5 model showing superior fidelity for reconstruction
  and the SwinMR model providing higher perceptual scores. There is no statistical
  difference with the reference for all diffusion tensor parameters at AF $times 2$
  or most DT parameters at AF $times 4$, and the quality of most diffusion tensor
  parameter maps are visually acceptable. SwinMR is recommended as the optimal approach
  for reconstruction at AF $times 2$ and AF $times 4$. However, we believed the models
  discussed in this studies are not prepared for clinical use at a higher AF. At AF
  $times 8$, the performance of all models discussed remains limited, with only half
  of the diffusion tensor parameters being recovered to a level with no statistical
  difference from the reference. Some diffusion tensor parameter maps even provide
  wrong and misleading information.
