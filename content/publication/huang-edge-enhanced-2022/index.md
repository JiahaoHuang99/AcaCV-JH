abstract: In clinical medicine, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most
  important tools for diagnosis, triage, prognosis, and treatment planning. However,
  MRI suffers from an inherent slow data acquisition process because data is collected
  sequentially in k-space. In recent years, most MRI reconstruction methods proposed
  in the literature focus on holistic image reconstruction rather than enhancing the
  edge information. This work steps aside this general trend by elaborating on the
  enhancement of edge information. Specifically, we introduce a novel parallel imaging
  coupled dual discriminator generative adversarial network (PIDD-GAN) for fast multi-channel
  MRI reconstruction by incorporating multi-view information. The dual discriminator
  design aims to improve the edge information in MRI reconstruction. One discriminator
  is used for holistic image reconstruction, whereas the other one is responsible
  for enhancing edge information. An improved U-Net with local and global residual
  learning is proposed for the generator. Frequency channel attention blocks (FCA
  Blocks) are embedded in the generator for incorporating attention mechanisms. Content
  loss is introduced to train the generator for better reconstruction quality. We
  performed comprehensive experiments on Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset
  and compared our method with state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods. Ablation
  studies of residual learning were conducted on the MICCAI13 dataset to validate
  the proposed modules. Results show that our PIDD-GAN provides high-quality reconstructed
  MR images, with well-preserved edge information. The time of single-image reconstruction
  is below 5ms, which meets the demand of faster processing.
