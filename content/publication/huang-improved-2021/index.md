abstract: The abuse of miniature cameras has severely violated information security
  and privacy. Several unsolved challenges such as small or multiple targets detection
  as well as complex background environments in terms of active laser detection still
  exist, resulting in difficulties in its practical application. In this paper, an
  active laser detection system is proposed to obtain high-intensity cat-eye reflection
  images. An improved YOLOv3 model, YOLOv3-4L, was introduced to detect the actual
  position of the target. In the YOLOv3-4L model, each image was resized to 608Ã—608
  to preserve image details. The scales of prediction were increased from three to
  four, and an additional feature map was used to extract more details. YOLOv3-4L
  exhibited excellent performance in detecting small targets. The experimental results
  show that the mean average precision achieved by YOLOv3-4L was 90.37%, compared
  to the 85.41%,87.81%, and 88.97% achieved by traditional YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, and
  Single Shot Multi-box Detector respectively. The speed of the YOLOv3-4L model meets
  the requirements of real-time target detection.
