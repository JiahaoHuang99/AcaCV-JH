abstract: Diffusion tensor cardiac magnetic resonance (DT-CMR) is a method capable
  of providing non-invasive measurements of myocardial microstructure. Image registration
  is essential to correct image shifts due to intra and inter breath-hold motion and
  imperfect cardiac triggering. Registration is challenging in DT-CMR due to the low
  signal-to-noise and various contrasts induced by the diffusion encoding in the myocardium
  and surrounding organs. Traditional deformable registration corrects through-plane
  motion but at the risk of destroying the texture information while rigid registration
  inefficiently discards frames with local deformation. In this study, we explored
  the possibility of deep learning-based deformable registration on DT-CMR. Based
  on the noise suppression using low-rank features and diffusion encoding suppression
  using variational auto encoder-decoder, a B-spline based registration network extracted
  the displacement fields and maintained the texture features of DT-CMR. In this way,
  our method improved the efficiency of frame utilization, manual cropping, and computational
  speed.
