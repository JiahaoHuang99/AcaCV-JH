abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in the field of medical image
  analysis. Harmonizing the convolution and multi-head self-attention mechanism is
  a recent research focus in this field, with various combination methods proposed.
  However, the lack of interpretability of these hybrid models remains a common pitfall,
  limiting their practical application in clinical scenarios. To address this issue,
  we propose to incorporate the Shifted Window (Swin) Deformable Attention into a
  hybrid architecture to improve segmentation performance while ensuring explainability.
  Our proposed Swin Deformable Attention Hybrid UNet (SDAH-UNet) demonstrates state-of-the-art
  performance on both anatomical and lesion segmentation tasks. Moreover, we provide
  a direct and visual explanation of the model focalization and how the model forms
  it, enabling clinicians to better understand and trust the decision of the model.
  Our approach could be a promising solution to the challenge of developing accurate
  and interpretable medical image segmentation models. https://github.com/wlc2424762917/SDAH_UNet
