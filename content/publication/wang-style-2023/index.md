abstract: This study proposes a pipeline that incorporates a novel style transfer
  model and a simultaneous super-resolution and segmentation model. The proposed pipeline
  aims to enhance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images by translating them into the
  late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) domain, which offers a larger amount of data with
  high-resolution and distinct highlighting of myocardium infarction (MI) areas. Subsequently,
  the segmentation task is performed on the LGE style image. An end-to-end super-resolution
  segmentation model is introduced to generate high-resolution mask from low-resolution
  LGE style DTI image. Further, to enhance the performance of the model, a multi-task
  self-supervised learning strategy is employed to pre-train the super-resolution
  segmentation model, allowing it to acquire more representative knowledge and improve
  its segmentation performance after fine-tuning. https://github.com/wlc2424762917/Med_Img
