abstract: Aiming at the characteristics of hyper-spectral imaging, a scheme for detecting
  tiny cameras based on three-dimensional features was proposed. The results were
  accurately determined in the spectral dimension after the suspected target was screened
  out by the cat's eye effect in the space dimension. According to the camera structure,
  the reflection spectral characteristics of the visible light camera were analyzed.
  Based on the geometric optics and radiometry, the detection distance of the system
  was calculated and simulated. The results show that if the equipment is working
  properly, the optical power affects the minimum detection distance, while the target
  size affects the maximum detection distance. A tiny-camera spectral feature verification
  system was built. The results show that the non-reflective light ratio curve of
  the target using the absorptive infrared cut-off filter changes smoothly and the
  value is high. As for the curve of the target using the reflective infrared cut-off
  filter, the value is high in visible light part while it is low in infrared part,
  and the curve begins to drop near 700 nm and even mutates where the absolute slope
  value is more than 10 times as it in the infrared band according to the experimental
  data. The experimental results are consistent with the expected results of the analysis,
  which proves the feasibility of hyper-spectral imaging technology to detect tiny
  cameras.
