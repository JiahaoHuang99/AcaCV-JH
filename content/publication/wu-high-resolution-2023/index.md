abstract: Diffusion Tensor Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DT-CMR) is the only in vivo
  method to non-invasively examine the microstructure of the human heart. Current
  research in DT-CMR aims to improve the understanding of how the cardiac microstructure
  relates to the macroscopic function of the healthy heart as well as how microstructural
  dysfunction contributes to disease. To get the final DT-CMR metrics, we need to
  acquire diffusion weighted images of at least 6 directions. However, due to DWI's
  low signal-to-noise ratio, the standard voxel size is quite big on the scale for
  microstructures. In this study, we explored the potential of deep-learning-based
  methods in improving the image quality volumetrically (x4 in all dimensions). This
  study proposed a novel framework to enable volumetric super-resolution, with an
  additional model input of high-resolution b0 DWI. We demonstrated that the additional
  input could offer higher super-resolved image quality. Going beyond, the model is
  also able to super-resolve DWIs of unseen b-values, proving the model framework's
  generalizability for cardiac DWI superresolution. In conclusion, we would then recommend
  giving the model a high-resolution reference image as an additional input to the
  low-resolution image for training and inference to guide all super-resolution frameworks
  for parametric imaging where a reference image is available.
